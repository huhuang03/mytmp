It's a tool to crate a test project by template type.


A test project is a simple project for test some single through.
And it's boring to create those project by hand.
So this project is for create by code.

t template_name
#+END_SRC


* Install
- clone this project.
- run `npm run link`

** For example
#+BEGIN_SRC 
t cmake
#+END_SRC

will create
#+BEGIN_SRC
- t_cmake
    - build
    - src
        - CMakeList.txt
        - main.cc
#+END_SRC

* TODOS
- no args, print all templates
- t template work
- replace all place holder
